Business Intelligence Internship – 8 Week Journey (BI Architect Track)

This repository documents my 8-week (2 months) internship experience working as a Business Intelligence Architect, focused on building end-to-end analytical solutions using Power BI, DAX, and SQL-based modeling.

What This Repository Represents

Real-world BI problem solving, not tutorial demos

Architect-level thinking: data modeling → measures → visuals → performance

Emphasis on correct DAX logic, clean models, and business-driven insights

Core Skills & Technologies Learned
Data Modeling & SQL BI

Star schema and snowflake schema design

Fact and dimension table separation

SQL-based data preparation and transformations

Relationship cardinality, filter direction, and performance implications
